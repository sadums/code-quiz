# Code Quiz

## Description

This project is a JavaScrip coding quiz. There are 3 seperate difficulties each with a time limit of 60 seconds. Every wrong answer will dock 10 seconds! At the end of each quiz, you may save your high score.

I built this project to better learn how javascript interacts with html, as well as local storage. I wanted to make a clean JavaScript quiz for people to test their knowledge and see how high they can score. I was able to learn a lot of bootstrap and jquery commands/classes. This project also helped me learn how to organize a big file.
